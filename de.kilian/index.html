                        <li>It's Open Source</li>
                        <li>It respects your privacy</li>
                        <li>You can modify it entirely (even its kernel)</li>
                        <li>It doesn't eat up your RAM</li>
                        <li>It doesn't force you to only use Edge</li>
                        <li>Most of them have their own packet manager</li>
                        <li>You don't need to create an account on the internet to use it</li>

                <br> "But.. But <strong>hackerz</strong>!"<br>
                <br> What if I told you that over 90% of all servers run some sort of Linux and have perfectly dealt with those hackers already?</p>
