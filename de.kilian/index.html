                    <ul>
                        <li>It's Open Source</li>
                        <li>It respects your privacy</li>
                        <li>You can modify it entirely (even its kernel)</li>
                        <li>It doesn't eat up your RAM</li>
                        <li>It doesn't force you to only use Edge</li>
                        <li>Most of them have their own packet manager</li>
                        <li>You don't need to create an account on the internet to use it</li>

                <p><br>"But Open Source means <em>everyone</em> can see how it works!"<br>
                    <br>Yeah... That is the point...<br>
                <br> "But.. But <strong>hackerz</strong>!"<br>
                    <!-- strong hackerz strong!!! -->
                <br> What if I told you that over 90% of all servers run some sort of Linux and have perfectly dealt with those hackers already?</p>

                <p>There's a certain amount of decency that is always required. Sadly, a lot of cooperations have put that decency into formality.<br>
                Now, almost everyone just accepts how little insight they have in their operating systems.<br>
                All the time we get to hear how the insight makes everything complicated, leaving me to wonder how NOT having any kind of insight<br>
                makes things easier. Of course, I've heard of the saying "ignorance is bliss", but please get me right:<br>
                How do you deal with the lingering feeling of unease? Not knowing how something works, while you entrust it with your most personal data?<br>
                "I don't care about my privacy!" is another one I've heard, and I don't even want to begin to wrap my head around that mindset.<br>
                I do not mind people with such opinions, however having that mindset be forced onto you is just horrid!<br>
                Dumb costumers are likelier to pay for such stuff, so I suppose big coorps try their best to dumb us down.<br>
                <br>Okay... So before this turns into another one of those revolutionary speeches of mine, I'll make a cut here<br>
                Boiling my blood like that will only kill me one day.</p>
